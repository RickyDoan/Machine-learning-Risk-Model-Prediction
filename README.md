 👉 I recently developed a Loan and Credit Risk Analysis tool app that leverages machine learning to predict the probability of loan defaults, credit scores, and risk ratings (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent).
Machine Learning Highlights:
🔍 This app has used the Model training call logistic regression to optimize the accuracy by using the Classification type.
📊 Beside of that, I'm using the feature engineering for financial metrics to determine the VIF, Corr, IV to reduce the feature which unimpacted the data.
🎯 Morevover, the Scalable prediction pipeline which help to preprocessing and one-hot encoding the categorical feature.
I have built using Streamlit and this app provides real-time insights based on user inputs like income, loan amount, and other financial details. It's been an exciting journey applying ML techniques to solve practical financial challenges!
I would love to hear your feedback and connect with others working on ML in finance. 🌟
